Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Overview of the Application:  This application serves as a showcase for models deployed by organizations and developers. It's designed to go live in its current state, so it's crucial to create an interface that's both informative and enticing. The application aims to capture the essence of a real-life production app, displaying various available models, their categories, and enabling end-users to select and explore any model.
